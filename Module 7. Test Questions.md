## üß† High-Impact Test Questions and Brain Teasers

Welcome to the test assignment section of **Module 7: Crafting Detailed User Guides**. This segment assesses your technical writing proficiency, structuring logic, user-centric perspective, and advanced reasoning ability in documentation design.

Below is a curated mix of **technical writing challenges**, **brain teasers**, and **scenario-based questions**.

Use this as a standalone README to evaluate learners, test documentation team members, or assign during technical writing recruitment cycles.

## üß™ SECTION B: Rewrite Tasks (Live Editing)

> You are given flawed documentation snippets. Rewrite each according to Module 7 principles.

**6. Rewrite this paragraph using proper instructional tone, sequence, and directness:**

> In order to be able to create a new account, the user is expected to go to the settings menu, locate the accounts tab, and perhaps click on something labeled as 'Create'.

---

**7. Reformat the following into a clear H1-H3 hierarchy and numbered steps:**

> Setting Up Notifications
> Go to Settings. Choose Alerts. Click Add New. Select a channel. Enter details. Save.

---

## üîÑ SECTION C: Advanced Task Breakdown

**8. Break the following process into *atomic steps* and identify a visual indicator for each step:**

> Installing our CLI tool requires downloading the .zip, unzipping it, opening terminal, running install.sh, and verifying installation via "mycli --version".

---

**9. Create a role-based documentation matrix for the following feature:**

> A permission dashboard where Admins can add users, Viewers can only read logs, and Editors can update metadata.

---

## üß† SECTION D: Brain Teasers (High-Level Conceptual Reasoning)

**10. Can a single user guide effectively serve both first-time users and advanced power users? Justify your answer using documentation patterns.**

---

**11. Imagine you're writing a guide for a file-sharing SaaS with enterprise and student users. Which tone guidelines would you apply and how would you handle conflicts between tone expectations?**

---

**12. If a user guide is too detailed, users skim and miss steps. If too brief, they get lost. How do you strike the right balance? Include structural and formatting suggestions.**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è SECTION E: Tools and Application ‚Äì Scenario-Based Writing

**13. You are documenting the onboarding flow of a payment dashboard. Outline the structure of the user guide, including at least 5 key sections and 2 visual types to include.**

---

**14. Imagine the app UI changes every 2 weeks. Design a doc maintenance strategy using GitHub and feedback workflows.**

---

## üß© BONUS SECTION: Meta-Writing Challenge

**15. Write a short guide titled: "How to Write a Good Onboarding Guide for New Writers". It should include structure, tone tips, and revision pointers. (200‚Äì250 words)**
