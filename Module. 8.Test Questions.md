### üß† **Short Answer Questions**

5. **Explain how semantic HTML improves accessibility for screen reader users. Provide examples.**

6. **Describe how plain language contributes to the ‚ÄúUnderstandable‚Äù principle of WCAG. How would you enforce this in a cross-functional team?**

7. **You‚Äôre writing a documentation set for a financial platform. How would you ensure that visually impaired users can understand a complex pie chart comparing monthly expenses?**

8. **What is the relationship between keyboard navigation and cognitive load in accessible documents?**

### üîç **Scenario-Based Challenges**

9. **Scenario:**
   A documentation portal for a government service uses colored buttons (green for ‚ÄúAccept,‚Äù red for ‚ÄúDecline‚Äù) with no accompanying text labels.

   **Question:**
   Identify at least 3 accessibility violations present in this setup and propose compliant design alternatives.

10. **Scenario:**
    Your product team insists on embedding video tutorials without transcripts in the onboarding documentation to "keep it visual."

    **Question:**
    Craft a strong accessibility-oriented argument (with standards references) against this practice and offer an alternative workflow.

### üß† **Brain Teasers**

These questions are not just about right or wrong‚Äîthey push your reasoning and creativity in solving accessibility challenges.

---

11. **Accessibility Paradox**

> "Removing a keyboard trap makes your site more accessible, but can introduce security issues on login forms."
> **Question:** How would you resolve this conflict while remaining WCAG-compliant?

---

12. **Color Dependency Thought Experiment**
    You‚Äôve designed a multi-step instructional guide using only blue arrows and green checkmarks to indicate completed steps.

**Question:**
Without using colors or reworking the layout entirely, how can you make the document accessible to people with Deuteranopia (red-green color blindness)?

---

13. **The Font Size Dilemma**
    The design system your team uses has a fixed font size of 13px. Accessibility guidelines recommend at least 16px for body text.

**Question:**
How would you approach this conflict between design fidelity and accessibility compliance in your documentation system?

---

14. **Glitch in the AI**
    An automated accessibility checker (e.g., Axe) shows ‚Äúno issues,‚Äù but a screen reader user complains they can‚Äôt access dropdown content.

**Question:**
Why might this happen, and what manual test(s) would you perform to uncover the issue?

---

15. **Case Study Simulation**
    Imagine you're auditing a 50-page API documentation site. The site has headings in all caps (`GETTING STARTED`, `AUTHORIZATION`, etc.), inconsistent use of ARIA roles, and complex terminology without a glossary.

**Question:**
List at least five steps you would take to bring this documentation set into full accessibility compliance, referencing specific WCAG principles.

---

### üìù Bonus: Documentation Rewrite Challenge

**Rewrite the following example to meet accessibility and plain language guidelines:**

> "Initiate authentication by utilizing your pre-established credentials via the designated login interface. Upon successful verification, proceed to the application dashboard."

**Accessibility Rewrite Example:**

> "Log in using your username and password. Once verified, you‚Äôll be directed to your dashboard."
