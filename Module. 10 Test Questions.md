## 🧠 Brain Teasers & Diagnostic Challenges

> Elevate your collaboration strategy with scenario-based reasoning and critical documentation thinking.

### 🔍 Teaser 1: The Time-Warped SME

You're documenting an internal API. Rajiv (Backend SME) gives you the endpoint logic, but a week later you notice the actual staging environment returns different fields than described. Rajiv insists the behavior is unchanged.

* ❓ What verification steps should you follow?
* 🧠 How do you communicate the discrepancy diplomatically?

---

### 🧩 Teaser 2: The Vague Validator

An SME says, “Users shouldn’t ever see this error, so no need to document it.” But in your testing, it appears under specific edge cases.

* ❓ How do you challenge this assumption while maintaining trust?
* 🔧 What’s your fallback strategy if the SME refuses to acknowledge the issue?

---

### 🔄 Teaser 3: The SME Proxy Problem

You're asked to document a payment gateway, but the SME is unavailable and you’re referred to a QA analyst who “might know a bit.”

* ❓ How do you adapt your interview strategy for an SME proxy?
* 🔍 What documentation methods can ensure you validate details despite second-hand information?

---

### 🧩 Teaser 4: The Contradicting SMEs

Lisa (Product) insists the onboarding flow should auto-save draft inputs. Anita (SRE) says saving to disk causes latency and shouldn't happen.

* ❓ How do you break this deadlock?
* 📘 What’s your process to document the logic without choosing sides?

## 🧪 Technical Review Test Assignments

Designed to simulate real-world scenarios with incomplete or conflicting SME input.

---

### ✍️ Assignment 1: Clarifying Vague SME Responses

> “It just works after login.”

**Task:**

* Write 3 technical follow-up questions that could help clarify what “just works” means.
* Propose a structured paragraph that documents the behavior in the absence of SME input, clearly marking assumptions.

✅ **Deliverable**: 150–200 word paragraph + questions.

---

### 🎙 Assignment 2: SME Interview Simulation

**Scenario**: You conducted a Zoom interview with Yusuf (QA Analyst). He described a new test workflow in broad strokes.

**Task:**

* Turn the 10-minute transcript into a clear, structured, 2-page user guide.
* Identify missing information, flag it for review, and document your assumptions transparently.

✅ **Deliverable**: Markdown document + change log of what requires SME follow-up.

---

### 🧪 Assignment 3: Documentation Audit Exercise

**Task:**

* You’re given a 1-page API guide that contains two critical errors and an undocumented edge case.
* Identify the inconsistencies and draft a formal query email to the SME requesting clarification.

✅ **Deliverable**: Annotated API guide + email template.

---

### 🧠 Assignment 4: Creating an SME Review Checklist

**Task:**
Design a reusable SME Review Checklist tailored to:

* Frontend workflows
* Backend APIs
* SRE/system reliability docs

Include categories for:
☐ Terminology Accuracy
☐ Flow Consistency
☐ Logs/Error Message Mapping
☐ Test Environment Validation
☐ Risk or Limitation Disclosure

✅ **Deliverable**: Markdown checklist template.

---

### 🔧 Assignment 5: Conflict Reconciliation Log

**Scenario**: Two SMEs give conflicting definitions for the same parameter in your integration guide.

**Task:**

* Document both views neutrally
* Create a Google Doc-style conflict log
* Draft a resolution request message for a joint meeting

✅ **Deliverable**: Conflict Log table + meeting summary prompt
